# LIA_speech

This repository contains speech software developed by the LIA partner in the framework of the SELMA project.
These software are research tools engined by very recent technologies. 
For some (most) of them, integration work is still necessary to make these software accessible to a non-specialist public.

Among this repo, ASR models engined by SpeechBrain are available. These last months (these lines are written in March 29, 2022) a strong effort has been made by the LIA researchers on wav2vec 2.0 models.
The ASR models built in the framework of SELMA in 2021-January/March 2022, and available in this repository, target the following languages:
- French 
- Brazilian Portuguese
- Modern Standard Arabic
- Tunisian dialect
